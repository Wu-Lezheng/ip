## Usage

### `date` - Lists tasks on a given day

Super Duke describes to you a list of tasks (either a `deadline` or `event`) that take place on a specified date.

**Example of usage:**

`date 2022-09-04`

`date 2022/09/04`

**Expected outcome:**

Shows a list of tasks with matching date as that entered by the user, such as below.

```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1. [D][X] 2101 essay (by: Sep 04 2022)
2. [D][ ] submit report (by: Sep 04 2022)
```

-------------------

### `deadline` - Adds a deadline

Super Dukes adds a task with a specified deadline to storage.

**Example of usage:**

`deadline prepare slides /by 2022-09-14`

`deadline submit ip /by 2022/09/16`

**Expected outcome:**

Adds the given deadline successfully to the storage!

Shows the total number of current tasks.

```
Got it. I've added this task:
 [D][ ] prepare slides (by: Sep 14 2022)
Now you have 7 tasks in the list.
```

Super Duke checks for duplicates, so if you enter the same task more than once, Super Duke will be annoyed!

```
â˜¹ Don't you realise the input task has already been stored in the task list?
```

***The checking applies to `event` and `deadline` features as well.***

-------------------

### `delete` - Deletes a task

Super Duke removes the task specified by its index in the list from storage.

**Example of usage:**

**Expected outcome:**

Shows to the user the specified task and removes it from storage successfully.

Now you have 7 tasks in the list.
```

-------------------

### `event` - Adds an event

Super Dukes adds a task that takes place on a specific date to storage.

**Expected outcome:**

Adds the given event successfully to the storage!
